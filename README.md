Operational Performance Analytics & Prediction Pipeline

Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data science and analytics engineering workflow, from raw data ingestion through to predictive modelling and insight delivery. It is inspired by real-world operational and service performance challenges in regulated, high-volume environments.

The goal is to show how data can be transformed into actionable insight and predictive signals using clean engineering practices.
